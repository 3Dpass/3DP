//! # poscanAssets Pallet
//!
//! A module for dealing with fungible and non-fungible assets issued as either independent 
//! currencies (tokens) or backed tokens (currencies backed by the object, according to 3DPRC-2 
//! tokenization standard rules). For example, the tokenization of the object properties, such as: 
//! share (%), grams, kilograms, square meters, etc. The module represents a modification of the 
//! Assets pallet provided by Substrate, so its API is quite similar.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The poscanAssets module provides such options as:
//!
//! * Asset Issuance (Minting)
//! * Asset Transferal
//! * Asset Freezing
//! * Asset Destruction (Burning)
//! * Delegated Asset Transfers ("Approval API")
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! * **Admin**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to unfreeze (thaw) an account and it's
//!   assets, as well as forcibly transfer a particular class of assets between arbitrary accounts
//!   and reduce the balance of a particular class of assets of arbitrary accounts.
//! * **Asset issuance/minting**: The creation of a new asset, whose total supply will belong to the
//!   account that issues the asset. This is a privileged operation.
//! * **Asset transfer**: The reduction of the balance of an asset of one account with the
//!   corresponding increase in the balance of another.
//! * **Asset destruction**: The process of reduce the balance of an asset of one account. This is a
//!   privileged operation.
//! * **Fungible asset**: An asset whose units are interchangeable.
//! * **Issuer**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to mint a particular class of assets.
//! * **Freezer**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to freeze an account from
//!   transferring a particular class of assets.
//! * **Freezing**: Removing the possibility of an unpermissioned transfer of an asset from a
//!   particular account.
//! * **Non-fungible asset**: An asset for which each unit has unique characteristics.
//! * **Owner**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to destroy a particular asset class,
//!   or to set the Issuer, Freezer or Admin of that asset class.
//! * **Approval**: The act of allowing an account the permission to transfer some balance of asset
//!   from the approving account into some third-party destination account.
//! * **Sufficiency**: The idea of a minimum-balance of an asset being sufficient to allow the
//!   account's existence on the system without requiring any other existential-deposit.
//!
//! ### Vision
//!
//! The poscanAssets module allows for:

//! * Issuance of a unique asset and tether (or not to tether) it to the object previously approved by The Ledger of Things
//! (poScan module is being leveraged for the object authentication). The asset is possible to get tethered to one of the object properties like "non-fungible", "share", "grams", etc. And only one property must be chosen for the tokenization. It is prohibited to have the object tokenized twice simultaneously (ex. you cannot get tokenized both the object share and its weight, you have to pick up one). The object properties are managed by poScan module, as well.
//! * Moving assets among accounts.
//! * The assets management - collective ownership, decision making process, etc.
//! * Administrative activities by specially privileged accounts including freezing account
//!   balances and minting/burning assets.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Permissionless Functions
//!
//! * `create`: Creates a new asset class, taking the required deposit.
//! * `transfer`: Transfer sender's assets to another account.
//! * `transfer_keep_alive`: Transfer sender's assets to another account, keeping the sender alive.
//! * `set_metadata`: Set the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `clear_metadata`: Remove the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `approve_transfer`: Create or increase an delegated transfer.
//! * `cancel_approval`: Rescind a previous approval.
//! * `transfer_approved`: Transfer third-party's assets to another account.
//!
//! ### Permissioned Functions
//!
//! * `force_create`: Creates a new asset class without taking any deposit.
//! * `force_set_metadata`: Set the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `force_clear_metadata`: Remove the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `force_asset_status`: Alter an asset class's attributes.
//! * `force_cancel_approval`: Rescind a previous approval.
//!
//! ### Privileged Functions
//! * `destroy`: Destroys an entire asset class; called by the asset class's Owner.
//! * `mint`: Increases the asset balance of an account; called by the asset class's Issuer.
//! * `burn`: Decreases the asset balance of an account; called by the asset class's Admin.
//! * `force_transfer`: Transfers between arbitrary accounts; called by the asset class's Admin.
//! * `freeze`: Disallows further `transfer`s from an account; called by the asset class's Freezer.
//! * `thaw`: Allows further `transfer`s from an account; called by the asset class's Admin.
//! * `transfer_ownership`: Changes an asset class's Owner; called by the asset class's Owner.
//! * `set_team`: Changes an asset class's Admin, Freezer and Issuer; called by the asset class's
//!   Owner.
//!
//! Please refer to the [`Call`] enum and its associated variants for documentation on each
//! function.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//! <!-- Original author of descriptions: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! * `balance` - Get the asset `id` balance of `who`.
//! * `total_supply` - Get the total supply of an asset `id`.
