# Contributing

In order to contribute and help 3DPass solve the Global Digital Transformation Challenge feel free to implement or develop new recognition algorithms into [pass3d](https://github.com/3Dpass/pass3d) toolkit (e.x. face recognition, fingerprint recognition, radio signal, 2D drawings, melody, voice, 3D objects, etc.). 

However, it always encourages that developers contribute to 3DPass growth, would it be mining tools, network features, dApps, smart-contracts, impementations, new projects and ideas etc. Dive down into [3Dpass contribution rewards program](https://3dpass.org/coin#distribution-contribution).

# Guidelines

 **Your help is always Welcome!**

Feel free to open Pull Request if you already have somethinfg useful to add. If you haven't yet, we gathered some docs down below:
-   The [HASH ID](https://3dpass.org/features#3drecognition-hash-id)
-   The [Multi object options](https://3dpass.org/features#multiobject)
-   The [Proof of Scan](https://3dpass.org/proof-of-scan) docs
-   The [Grid2D](https://3dpass.org/grid2d) recognition algorithm description
-   The [Node interaction API](https://github.com/3Dpass/3DP/wiki)
-   The [Integration](https://3dpass.org/features#integration)

## Reporting Bugs

Another way to contribute, is to report issues you find when using the 3DPass. You may
report new issues at [here](https://github.com/3Dpass/3DP/issues). When reporting, please inlcude the following information.

-   **Short summary of the issue encountered** - In a sentence or two explain what the issue is at a
    high level.
-   **Steps to reproduce** - What actions did you take to notice the issue? Did you submit a
    particular extrinsic? Did you compile the code a particular way? What command did you run the
    node with?
-   **Expected Behavior** - What were you expecting to happen when you encountered the bug?
-   **Observed Behavior** - What actually happened when you encountered the bug?
-   **Additional Relevant Information** - What error message did you receive? What OS and rust
    compiler are you using?

## Proposing Changes and Additions

If you would like to make a change or addition to 3DPass Node, you do not need anyone's permission
to get started. You simply open a Pull Request against. Of course, not all changes will be accepted,
and changes should either be in line with the existing structure or refactor that structure
for a good reason. If you want preliminary input from the Nodes' maintainers before beginning,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/3Dpass/3DP/issues) discussing your
idea first. Either approach (PR or issue) is welcome.

### What to Contribute

Anything you think will make 3DPass better, is worth proposing. Here are some ideas to get you
started. All of these ideas and more are listed in our
[issue queue](https://github.com/3Dpass/3DP/issues)

-   **Test Coverage** - Not all code is covered, and not all covered code is covered well, but we
    would like more and better coverage.
-   **New recipes** - If you know how to do something useful that is not yet covered in
    3DPass, please contribute.
-   **UX improvements** - Any way to make it easier and less confusing to get new users onboarded is
    welcome.
-   **CI Improvements** - The more tests we have automated, the higher quality 3DPass Node will be.
